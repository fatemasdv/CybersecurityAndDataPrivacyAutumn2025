# Phase 4 - GDPR and Privacy by Design Review

## Introduction
As part of the cybersecurity audit, this phase evaluates the Booking System's adherence to GDPR regulations. We act as penetration testers to ensure data privacy is integrated into the system's architecture.

## System Features
- **User Management:** Secure registration for reservers and administrators.
- **Age Verification:** Mandatory check to ensure users are over 15 years old.
- **Data Protection:** Passwords are hashed, and CSRF protection is active.
- **Privacy by Design:** Reserver identities are hidden from the public view of bookings.

## Conclusion
The system is now **Fully GDPR Compliant** following the addition of the Data Breach Response Plan.
