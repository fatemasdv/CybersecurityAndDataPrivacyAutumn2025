# GDPR Compliance Summary – Web-based Booking System

| Area | Summary |
|------|---------|
| **Personal Data Mapping & Minimization** | Most personal data used by the system has been identified, and data collection is generally limited to what is necessary. Age verification is considered, but needs consistent enforcement. |
| **User Registration & Management** | Basic GDPR consent exists, and administrators can delete user data. However, user self-management features and consent handling need improvement. |
| **Booking Visibility** | Booking information is mostly protected, with public users seeing only resource-level data. There is still a risk of limited exposure that should be fully eliminated. |
| **Access Control & Authorization** | Role separation exists, but access control is not fully enforced. Administrator privileges require clearer limitations to prevent misuse of personal data. |
| **Privacy by Design** | Privacy-friendly design principles are partially implemented. Logging and default data protection practices need further refinement. |
| **Data Security** | Core security measures such as protection against common attacks are in place. However, backup policies and data location compliance need better documentation and controls. |
| **Data Anonymization & Pseudonymization** | Some anonymization is applied, but pseudonymization is not consistently used across the system. |
| **Data Subject Rights** | User rights such as data access, deletion, and consent withdrawal are recognized but are mostly manual and not fully automated. |
| **Documentation & Communication** | A privacy policy exists, but internal documentation and a formal data breach response plan are missing or incomplete. |

## Overall Assessment
⚠️ **Partially GDPR compliant**  
The system meets several GDPR requirements but needs improvements in documentation, automation of user rights, stronger access control, and a clear data breach response process.
